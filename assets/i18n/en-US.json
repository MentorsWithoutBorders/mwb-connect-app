				"text": "You will only feel motivated enough to take steps towards your goal if the plan for achieving it will become clearer and clearer. For this, you just need to ask yourself on a regular basis: “What else can I do in order to reach my goal?” then add below the ideas that you come up with and act on them gradually.",

			},
			"main": {
				"title": "",
				"text": "In order to achieve any goal, you need to generate a continuous stream of ideas, energy and confidence channelled towards that goal and the way to do this is very simple: you just need to think about the moment in the future when your goal will become real and then you also need to ask yourself what steps you could take in order to get there, putting into practice the ideas that you come up with whenever you feel it’s appropriate to do so."
			},			
			"ideas": {
				"title": "Why we get ideas",
				"text": "Your subconscious mind is the warehouse of everything that you've seen, heard, felt, done, thought throughout your life and when you think about a clear goal and then you ask yourself \"what else can I do in order to achieve it?\", what happens is that you are gradually extracting ideas from this enormous warehouse of resources that you have at your disposal. As you act on the ideas that you're getting, you put in new information because you see, hear, feel, do, think new things so the next time when you think again about your goal and the steps to achieve it, you get even more ideas and this is how the journey towards your goal becomes clearer and clearer and you get closer and closer to it."
			},
			"energy": {
				"title": "Why we get energy",
				"text": "By running the simple mental process goal/steps on a regular basis you won't get only ideas but you'll also generate more and more energy because the process will gradually get transferred to the subconscious mind which will keep it running on auto-pilot, in the background, on an infinite loop and since this part of the mind is a tremendously powerful force that you have within yourself, any process that it keeps running in the background has the tendency of pushing the body in the direction of the goal which is at the end of that process."

			"confidence": {
				"title": "Why we get confidence",
				"text": "The subconscious mind cannot tell the difference between imagination and reality so for any process that you run in your mind you’ll feel that you’ve already gone through it in reality multiple times and this will give you more and more confidence that you’ll actually reach your goal."

			"extra_benefits": {
				"title": "Extra benefits",
				"text": "In addition to the benefits mentioned previously, there are 3 other very important reasons for running the mental process goal/steps on a regular basis:\n - even when you don’t get new ideas, you still generate more energy and confidence channelled towards your goal.\n- any change in the overall plan can lead to a significant change in the next immediate steps to follow.\n- you’ll be able to figure out in advance many obstacles that might show up along the way and this will give you enough time to prepare a plan B, plan C, etc. for those scenarios."

				"link": "Find out how"
			},
			"main": {
				"title": "",
				"text": "While pursuing your goals you will inevitably encounter various negative states such as anger, frustration, discouragement, worry, stress etc. and the longer you let these negative states manifest themselves, the more you’ll lose patience, joy and efficiency and there’s also a very high chance that you’ll give up at some point. So all you need to do in those moments is to simply relax efficiently because your body needs to feel good and relaxation is the most accessible feel good state that we have at our disposal."
			},
			"how_to_relax": {
				"title": "How to relax",
				"text": "With your eyes open or closed, standing up, sitting on a chair or lying down, you start by thinking of the number 10, you let the forehead relax and you also focus on how you’re letting it relax because in this way the relaxation effect will be a bit more intense, then you think of 9 and you focus on how you’re letting the neck relax, 8 and focus on how you’re letting the shoulders relax, 7 and focus on how you’re letting the arms relax and so on until you reach 1 and you focus on how you’re letting the feet relax and then, when you think of 0, you let the entire body relax and you keep focusing on how you let it relax until you reach a really feel good, relaxed state.\nThis last step is the most important one by far because from 10 to 1 you’re just preparing the body to relax and when you get to 1 you won’t be relaxed enough yet most of the time, that’s why when you think of 0 you have to keep focusing on how you’re letting the entire body relax until you get to that really feel good, relaxed state. Sometimes you’ll have to keep your focus there for a few seconds, other times for a few tens of seconds but you’ll notice that the more you focus on how you’re letting the entire body relax, the more relaxed your body will feel which means that you have complete control over the degree of relaxation that you want to get to. And your goal should always be to get to that really feel good relaxed state whenever you use this method."
			},
			"why_count_down": {
				"title": "Why count down",
				"text": "The negative states that you encounter are actually caused by some negative thoughts which are either conscious or unconscious and what you need first and foremost in those moments is to direct your mind towards other thoughts, preferably positive ones. This is not that easy to do though when you’re feeling really frustrated, angry, discouraged, stressed, etc. and that’s why the numbers will work very well for this purpose as they are very clear, neutral thoughts which are guaranteed to take your mind away from the negative thoughts that have caused the negative states in the first place. And if with each number you also let a part of the body relax and at the end the entire body, you’ll be able to get to that nice, feel good, relaxed state."
			},
			"interruptions": {
				"title": "Interruptions",
				"text": "While doing this relaxation you’ll notice that various thoughts will distract you. All you need to do in those moments is to simply realise that you got interrupted and continue from the number where the interruption happened (if you remember it, if not you can just continue from any number you want). The important thing is to never go back from 10 because sometimes you’ll have so many interruptions that if you keep going back from 10 you’ll never be able to finish the relaxation process."
			},
			"fast_slow_relaxation": {
				"title": "Fast and slow relaxation",
				"text": "There’s a fast way and a slow way of doing this relaxation, the only difference between them being that in the slow version you have 3–4 second intervals between 10 and 9, 9 and 8 and so on, whereas in the fast version you do the countdown faster, without these intervals but in both versions the most important part remains what you do when you get to 0: keep focusing on how you’re letting the entire body relax until you reach that really feel good, relaxed state."
			},
			"when_to_relax": {
				"title": "When to relax",
				"text": "The general rule of thumb is to do the fast relaxation immediately when you feel any negative state. Why immediately? Because the more you let any negative state manifest itself, the more you lose patience, joy and efficiency and any problem you encounter will seem much bigger than it actually is.\n\nThere will be many times though when some negative states will just keep coming back again and again and if you relax immediately in those moments it will feel more frustrating than relaxing. So only in those situations it’s best to let the negative emotions manifest themselves for a while and only then do the fast relaxation again.\n\nIf however you notice that some negative states keep coming back stronger and stronger and just by doing the fast relaxation you are not able to transition to a consistent feel good state, then you need to take a bit more time to do the slow relaxation. This can happen anytime, anywhere but you’ll need at least 2–3 minutes of quiet time in order to do it efficiently.\n\nYou also need to keep in mind that if your body is in movement and you get into a negative state at some point, you have to stop the body first and only then relax."

			},
			"main": {
				"title": "",
				"text": "As you know from the relaxation method, when you get interrupted by various thoughts during the relaxation process you just need to realise that you got interrupted and continue from where you were when the interruption happened and it will feel just as if nothing had interrupted you in the first place. It turns out that this works amazingly well for any activity.\n\nTo give you an example, let’s say that you’re reading something and your mind starts drifting away at some point. When this happens, you just need to realise that you’re not focusing on the reading activity anymore and switch your focus back to what you are reading. If you do this every time you get distracted by other thoughts, you’ll notice how you are gradually becoming more and more immersed in that activity and you’ll feel the pure joy of being there entirely. Reading is of course only an example and this will work just as well for any other activity."

			"in_your_head": {
				"title": "In your head",
