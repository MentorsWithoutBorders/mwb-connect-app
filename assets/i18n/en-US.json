    "programming": "<div style=\"text-align: justify; color: #646464; line-height: 1.3\">These days, there are very few jobs that don’t involve some level of technology use. But while most people are quite happy to simply be at the user end of that technology, you may be someone who wants to get stuck in and get involved in creating the systems and interfaces that other people use.<br><br><b>Reasons to pursue a programming career:</b><ol><li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px\"><b>You have opportunities without a degree.</b><br>Many organisations don’t require programming candidates to have a formal degree. They will be more interested in looking at your ability to learn on the job, your ability to work as part of a team and your willingness to tackle challenges. There is a huge amount of training courses available for major languages such as JavaScript, Python, Java, PHP, HTML, CSS and more – some of which you can learn to master in a matter of months.</li><li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px\"><b>You will be in demand.</b><br>The job market for programmers is excellent overall, but depending on what you choose to specialise in, you can become highly sought after. Industries such as banking, utilities and manufacturing are investing heavily in software development at the moment, but each sector will have their own specialist requirements. Whatever your main focus is, it’s a good idea to aim to have more than one area of expertise. This means that you’d be able to rapidly move into an alternative role in case your primary programming language becomes obsolete or less popular.</li><li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px\"><b>You will be a valued team member.</b><br>Teamwork is absolutely critical in all types of software development. The end solution will always depend on every member of the team making a valuable contribution, which makes you an important piece of the puzzle. In a modern business environment, programmers need to use a range of ‘people skills’ to engage and communicate with their colleagues and customers. You will be expected to share your knowledge and relay information that helps the entire team to make progress. More and more organisations adopt methodologies like Agile software development, which focuses heavily on creating a collaborative atmosphere where everyone adds value and learns from each other. This in turn results in faster delivery and higher quality of the end solution.</li><li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px\"><b>You will be constantly learning.</b><br>Programmers are on a constant learning journey. This can of course be said for most roles in business, but programmers do need to stay particularly well informed about new technological solutions and innovations. The ability to harness new ideas or platforms can make all the difference when it comes to a business’ ability to stay competitive in the marketplace. Many employers will work with you to build a development plan that allows you to do sponsored training and get various qualifications that will benefit you as well as the business.</li><li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px\"><b>You will have fun.</b><br>If you are a natural problem-solver, you will enjoy the process of creating software features and fixing bugs. You will get a great sense of achievement and satisfaction from delivering a solution that improves – perhaps even revolutionises – the way a business operates. And if you have been careful to choose an employer who knows how to reward its teams’ performance, you will get plenty of recognition for your contributions!</li></ol></div>",
    "product_management": "<div style=\"text-align: justify; color: #646464; line-height: 1.3\">Product management is building something from scratch or adding new features to an existing product. For example, building a complete e-commerce product itself or adding a search feature in an e-commerce product. However, it is not limited to that. It also comprises seeing the results of your hard work when the users are finding value in what you have built and continuously working towards building the best products for them.<br><br>Gathering information from different sources, prioritizing the tasks in hand, delegating the tasks, and delivering the final product that caters to the consumer’s needs are some of the things that a product manager actively does. Irrespective of what a PM does, they need to ensure that the product is aligned with the business goals.<br><br>You will find product managers working in start-ups as well as established companies handling consumer products, B2B products, B2C products, internal products, and so on. But at the core of everything they deliver a product that customers want and are willing to pay for. To do this, a product manager needs to be someone who has a vision and the ability to drive decisions and lead through influence.<br><br><b>Why should you consider a career in product management?</b><ol><li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px\">The role has a HUGE learning scope as it requires you to work with multiple cross-functional teams. Working with engineering, design, research, marketing, business, analytics, sales, support, and content teams is going to enrich your domain knowledge and experience. The skills that you will acquire through daily collaborations, communications, challenges, and frequent decision-making are going to turn you into a great leader for your career ahead.</li><li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px\">It is going to be addictive to solve users’ problems, seeing how the product you have built is being used by your end-users, and how it is impacting someone’s life.</li><li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px\">You will also get to communicate with the top leadership of the organization which will help you understand the vision of the organization better. Seeing the bigger picture will help you in making the right decisions for your product and organization.</li><li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px\">You will find the role flexible as you will be the one who will be driving the decisions and prioritizations of the tasks (of course in alignment with the business as already mentioned above.)</li></ol></div>",
    "design": "<div style=\"text-align: justify; color: #646464; line-height: 1.3\">Graphic design is an incredible career choice for those with a creative vision for their future. By entering a career which is increasingly digital, you can work from anywhere in the world. With in-demand graphic design skills, you can choose to find steady work in a multinational organization, work with local businesses on ad campaigns, or you could freelance, picking your own clients and working to your own schedule.<br><br>Designers use typography, photographs, illustrations, and graphic elements to construct messages that attract attention, cause us to think about their meaning, and stay in our memories over time.<br><br>Today, designers are increasingly working in the digital sphere. This means that graphic design is appearing across the internet and in apps. Design is becoming increasingly dynamic thanks to the adoption of technology in graphic design.<br><br>The location for a graphic designer’s work can vary radically, providing daily challenges that mean a designer’s job is always creative and interesting. They may work on adverts in physical media such as billboards, on the side of buses or in magazines and newspapers. Designers also design websites, and entire brand identities for companies that will be used across all their visual communications.<br><br><b>Reasons to choose a career in graphic design:</b><ol><li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px\"><b>You get paid for being creative.</b><br>At the heart of a graphic designer’s work is their creative spirit and when you become a graphic designer, you get to apply this every day. A graphic designer has to challenge themselves with deeper creative questions about how to express a message in a design. You’ll be involved in using color, shapes and symbols to express ideas that are at the heart of whatever campaign you’re working on.</li><li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px\"><b>You have the chance to make a difference.</b><br>When you’re a graphic designer, you can be involved in rewarding work that actually makes a difference in the world. You might work on governmental advertising campaigns that make a huge difference in society, encouraging people to give blood or take up the flu vaccine. Or maybe you’ll help local businesses spread the word about their wares, helping independent traders find new markets. In any case, graphic design is an outward looking profession and you’ll get to see tangible results in the real world.</li><li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px\"><b>Work from anywhere in the world.</b><br>The days of graphic designers only having the option to work with physical mediums are limited. Nowadays a fine understanding of Photoshop software, a laptop and a sketchpad are all the tools that a graphic designer needs to ply their trade. You won’t be tied to a desk or office, giving you incredible freedom to explore the world.<br><br>In an increasingly digital age, remote working is becoming more popular and more widely accepted by employers. This gives you the opportunity to travel while you work, or set up shop wherever you please.</li><li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px\"><b>You get to be your own boss.</b><br>In a visual and digital world there’s always going to be a demand for graphic designers. By manipulating the very medium in which companies communicate – graphics – you’re a valuable asset to any organization. Whilst there are always steady jobs for the designers looking to settle down, more graphic designers are choosing to freelance these days, giving you ultimate control over your working life.<br><br>In some cases, designers are even setting up their own design agencies. By building your client base you can turn your design work into your own business, building your own range of products from ad campaigns to newly designed fonts. As a graphic designer, the world’s your oyster.</li><li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px\"><b>Varied opportunities.</b><br>The world runs on a visual basis and almost every sector and industry needs graphic designers to tell their story. You could work for multinational brands like Apple, Google or Gucci. Charities rely on graphic designers to appeal to their audience, generating the necessary avenues of funding for their outreach projects. You can work for the government on messaging campaigns, encouraging folks to get out and vote or to understand government administrative systems such as tax and visas. Many of the world’s largest organizations have their own in-house team of designers and they’re always recruiting new, creative talent.<br><br>With a graphic design background, you speak a global language and there are a wide range of roles that you can fill. By upskilling in marketing, you can lead ad campaigns for the biggest agencies or by learning coding you could be building apps. Design is at the heart of so many jobs that graphic designers are never lacking in new opportunities.</li><li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px\"><b>Get onboard with digital.</b><br>The world is becoming increasingly digital and, as a global pandemic rocked the world in 2020, we’re spending more time than ever in virtual environments. Graphic designers are well placed to leverage this digital turn as they’re versed in the use of software to create incredible designs.<br><br>Digital design roles are on the rise and the demand for these positions is translating into increasingly lucrative salaries. Take advantage of a digital surge to maximize your income and your freedom to work from anywhere in the world.</li><li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px\"><b>Shape people’s feelings and actions.</b><br>Although ad campaigns or app designs are often ephemeral and a campaign may run for a few months or return once a year at Christmas, what lasts is the impression that your work leaves on its audience. Graphic design is art and the best examples leave a lasting mark on those who witness it.<br><br>Pursuing a career in graphic design gives you the tools to change hearts and minds, influencing people to give to charity or change their behavior in important, socially conscious ways. As a graphic designer your legacy isn’t just beautiful design, it’s marked changes in the way people live their lives.</li><li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px\"><b>Never get bored.</b><br>When you’re a graphic designer, no two days of work are ever the same. Working with visual mediums means that graphic designers bring together a wide range of elements, from typography and abstract graphics to coloring and logos. On any individual campaign you have so many creative directions to explore.<br><br>What’s more, creativity is great for your overall health. Creativity has been linked to reduced stress and anxiety and can even boost your immune system. Turning your passion into a profession through graphic design can have wide ranging benefits on your physical and emotional well-being.<br><br>Further, graphic designers who choose to freelance get to pick and choose their work to stay creatively engaged. You could spend one day designing social media posts for an independent business and the next work with a multinational organization developing long-term branding strategy. By working with a variety of clients in a creative way, you can guarantee that work never becomes a grind.</li><li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px\"><b>Have fun while you work!</b><br>By choosing a creative industry, you’ll surround yourself with vibrant individuals. Graphic design departments are filled with people who enjoy exploring the world around them, coming up with creative solutions to complex problems. Design studios are vibrant and exciting places to work thanks to the people that fill them.<br><br>If putting on a suit and tie everyday sounds like a bleak future, then design studios might be a place where you can express yourself. Generally speaking, these are fantastic and fulfilling environments in which to pursue your career – relaxed dress codes, creatively decorated offices and flexible patterns of work are the norm in design departments. Immerse yourself in a world of creativity and you’ll reap the benefits, having fun at work.</li></ol></div>",
    "customer_support": "<div style=\"text-align: justify; color: #646464; line-height: 1.3\">Customer service is a fantastic job. It’s unfairly considered as a “backup career” because customer support reps can enter the industry with any experience level and background. But customer service is at the core of a company’s success, making it one of the most vital roles you can play after product and sales. It allows you to impact the bottom line at your company while forging meaningful connections with your teammates and customers.<br><br>In fact, customer service might be the most important job at a company. According to Microsoft, 90% of consumers choose to do business with a company based on the quality of its customer service. You yourself might feel that way. How many times have you stopped doing business with a company because of a poor customer support experience? As a customer support rep, you’d directly impact how much revenue your company makes from returning customers.<br><br><b>Best reasons to work in customer support:</b><ol><li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px\"><b>You’ll develop your emotional intelligence.</b><br>It's a given that you'll develop people skills while working in a customer-facing role. And, although there can be challenges to working on the phones with customers all day, the skills and strategies you'll develop far outweigh those challenges.<br><br>You'll be helping customers solve a variety of different problems, which could have a huge impact on their personal or professional life. Your ability to empathize and wield social skills will be critical to build rapport with customers and get the information you need to help them.<br><br>In the face of difficult customers or combative language, you'll need to tap into your sense of self-regulation to calmly and effectively de-escalate customers so you can better assist them. During those tough days when you don't feel like you can make another phone call (we all have them), you’ll go into your senses of motivation and self-awareness to keep yourself on-track and positive so you can buckle down and get everything done.<br><br>Studies have shown that these people skills are linked more closely with success in the workplace than cognitive intelligence — especially when it comes to management. Starting your career in customer support sets you on the right track for building and growing these skills. (Plus, they're helpful for effective interpersonal relationship communication and collaboration, too.)</li><li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px\"><b>You’ll learn your product or service, inside and out.</b><br>To be successful in customer support, you need to understand every aspect of your product or service so you can quickly answer questions and resolve issues for your customers. But this isn't just a benefit for the people who will get the information they need ASAP — it's a big win for you, too.<br><br>Learning about your product or service helps you become a subject matter expert — which can open a ton of different doors for you as you grow in your career.<br><br>For example, by practicing teaching your customers how to use your product or service, you'll be able to specialize in training and onboarding new members of your customer support team and take on a leadership role. If you prefer writing, you might be able to start writing knowledge base articles or blog posts for your organization to supplement one-off customer support interactions. Or, you could use your creative side to create step-by-step product walkthrough videos to help your customers and build your online presence.<br><br>Regardless of the avenue you decide to take, an in-depth product or service knowledge will help you become an expert — on your team, within your organization, and in your industry.</li><li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px\"><b>You’ll build transferable skills.</b><br>Building your subject matter expertise will help you grow within your customer support team — but you'll also learn valuable skills that you can use to snag a new role if you want to branch out even further.<br><br><b>Sales skills</b><br>Working with customers will teach you exactly how customers can use your company's product or service to achieve their goals. You can use this knowledge and experience if you decided to move into sales. Social proof is an effective selling tool, and if you can tell prospects on the phone exactly how your product or service has helped other customers, they might be more interested in closing a deal with you.<br><br><b>Marketing skills</b><br>Product knowledge is incredibly valuable for your marketing team, too. Whether you want to write for the blog, conduct product and market research, or manage social media support channels, in-depth product expertise and killer communication skills could help you land a role on your marketing team.<br><br><b>Product development skills</b><br>If you know the product inside and out, you might be able to build it, too. If you develop some chops for product development — whether that consists of software engineering, outreach, or vendor management — you might be able to use your wealth of knowledge to facilitate a transition away from the phones. You can then work behind-the-scenes to build the product you're servicing.</li><li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px\"><b>You’ll learn how to effectively solve problems.</b><br>At the heart of it, customer support is about reactively helping your customers and solving their problems. And whether it's a quick fix or a multi-step process, every customer problem will require creative thinking, people skills, and expertise to solve.<br><br>The ability to solve problems quickly, effectively, and diplomatically is critical for any job — whether it's in customer support or not. The ability to problem-solve is the building block of being able to prioritize, project manage, and resolve conflicts, and these skills are required if you want to earn promotions, manage a team, and use your influence and expertise to achieve your goals.</li><li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px\"><b>You’ll master different communication mediums.</b><br>Many customer service teams require reps to work on different support channels. This means you'll go from working with customers on the phone one day to emailing them the next. But, as you continue to bounce between the various communication mediums your company offers, you'll eventually master the art of digital conversation.</li><li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px\"><b>You’ll collaborate with a diverse team.</b><br>Customer support teams aren't always your typical tech-oriented group. Many are full of interesting individuals who have unique personalities and perspectives.<br><br>This is helpful for growing your career as well. Being exposed to an array of different perspectives can help you find solutions to problems that you might not realize exist. It can also change your opinion on an issue after looking at it from an angle that you hadn't considered before. Situations like these where our perspective is challenged not only help us grow as professionals but as people, too.</li><li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px\"><b>You’ll learn to work remotely.</b><br>One growing trend in customer service is remote work. As customer service technology continues to enable reps to work from home, more customer service teams are taking advantage of this opportunity.<br><br>But, remote work isn't just a nice perk. It's a skill you'll need to develop, regardless of the career you pursue. As the cost of office space continues to rise and more positions go remote, you might soon find your role has become fully-remote as well. And, while this might not change what you do for a living, it will certainly change how you do it.<br><br>Getting exposure to remote work in a customer service role is great experience for any career. It challenges you to master your daily workflow without the immediate assistance of your surrounding colleagues. You learn how to independently troubleshoot problems and how to teach yourself solutions when no one is near to help.</li><li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px\"><b>You can build a network within your organization.</b><br>When you work in customer support, you might not always know the answer to a customer question. You might have to share customer feedback with important stakeholders. Or you might have insights to share that change how your company's leadership thinks about your ideal buyer persona.<br><br>To achieve any of the above, you'll have to pull knowledge from the people around you — your colleagues. If you can build a network of coworkers with different skillsets and expertise from you, not only will you be able to quickly and effectively get your job done, but you'll build a network of new opportunities for growth and professional development, too.<br><br>Whether you aspire to a long career in the customer support space, or you're simply eager to get your foot in the door at an innovative company, a job in customer support will teach you valuable skills that you'll need, again and again, over the course of your career.</li><li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px\"><b>You’ll directly impact the bottom line at your company.</b><br>When it comes to a company’s financial performance, it’s all too easy to overemphasize the role of sales and marketing in the firm’s success. But one can argue that customer service is truly the differentiating factor between a company that fails and one that succeeds.<br><br>The service experience makes the difference between a one-time customer and a loyal customer that keeps returning to the brand. Knowing that you’ll have such a big, real-world impact is one of the greatest perks of working in customer support. You’re not crunching numbers or looking at spreadsheets all day. Something as simple as a single positive phone call with a customer can end up turning into an upsell deal later.<br><br>That’s not to say it won’t be hard. Keeping a positive attitude while working in customer service is especially difficult when customers are being harsh and even illogical. But a bad customer is a customer you won’t want to keep. A good customer, however, can turn into a brand advocate after an excellent customer service experience — bringing in more referral business than a marketing campaign would.</li></ol></div>",
    "human_resources": "<div style=\"text-align: justify; color: #646464; line-height: 1.3\">When it comes to finding a fulfilling career path that focuses on helping others and having a positive impact, there are a variety of fields from which to choose. Careers in human resources specialize in serving the employees of a company and helping develop their growth and fulfillment in the workplace.<br><br>Human resources, or HR, is the department within a business or organization that supervises the management and development of employees. From administrative tasks to promoting a positive working environment, HR professionals deal with multiple parts of the business to manage the lives of employees.<br><br>This includes recruitment, training and hiring practices for new employees as well as training, development and compensation for existing employees. HR departments also handle conflict resolution and compliance.<br><br><b>Why should I work in Human Resources?</b><br><br>Careers in human resources, and the opportunity to work with people and help improve the lives of employees, can be fulfilling. Here are 7 reasons you may want to consider a career in HR:<ol><li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px\"><b>Help others.</b><br>HR professionals work directly with their fellow employees, helping them develop professionally so they can be their best selves in the workplace. From promoting professional development to resolving conflicts in the office, roles in human resources work directly to support employees and guide them along in their careers.</li><li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px\"><b>Position of influence.</b><br>Human resources employees have a unique perspective when it comes to their business or organization. Because they understand the finer details of how choices affect employees as well as management, they can often influence decisions for the good of the business and their fellow employees.</li><li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px\"><b>Stable career.</b><br>Regardless of industry, there will always be a need for professionals who can oversee the hiring, onboarding and retention of employees. Likewise, technology cannot easily substitute the interpersonal responsibilities of an HR department, making it a career choice that will last.</li><li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px\"><b>Problem-solving.</b><br>HR professionals are in charge of dealing with complex issues that arise in the workplace with sophistication. If you enjoy problem-solving and working through complicated interpersonal situations with others, you might appreciate the sort of work you will get to do with a career in HR.</li><li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px\"><b>Create a positive working environment.</b><br>Working in HR will give you the opportunity to influence the well-being and productivity of employees in the workplace, creating a more positive workplace culture.<br><br>For example, HR departments in many companies host professional development events or promote wellness programs targeted towards employees. These events contribute to a sense of company culture and increase motivation as well as talent retention.</li><li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px\"><b>Work for people.</b><br>Many individuals find their purpose is best fulfilled when they work directly with, and for others.<br><br>Whether it is guiding an employee through a promotion or helping new hires acclimate to the workplace, a career in human resources guarantees that you will work to help others find satisfaction and gratification in what they do.</li><li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px\"><b>Diverse roles and exciting things to do.</b><br>Because human resources is such a diverse and multifaceted industry, every day on the job will look different. If you enjoy a career that presents variety, the pace of a job in human resources will be one that you can keep up with.</li></ol></div>",
    "project_management": "<div style=\"text-align: justify; color: #646464; line-height: 1.3\">Project management is the process of organizing the project plan, project objectives, milestones, and deliverables of a project, as well as managing team members, timelines, and budgets to ensure that successful projects are delivered.<br><br>Project managers are in charge of planning, managing, and executing various projects. Effective project management entails assessing project feasibility, creating a project management plan, identifying key project deliverables — breaking them down into more manageable tasks, and assigning them to teams and staff. And finally, ensuring the project runs smoothly from start to finish.<br><br><b>Why you should consider a career in project management</b><br><br>A career in project management means you will likely be an integral part of all critical new initiatives at your company.<br><br>If you choose a career in project management, expect to be learning … constantly. Every project, every team, every task is unique. And while there is project management software that will make your life easier, every day is different.<ol><li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px\"><b>Straightforward career path.</b><br>Not all jobs have a clear career path. Some can be dead ends — not ideal. Still, others are wavy, with lateral moves likely — okay, if that fits your personality. However, project management career paths tend to have a straight-line trajectory.<br><br>A possible path may begin as an internship during college followed by a project coordinator. That role often leads to an assistant project manager, then project manager, then lead/senior project manager. At this point, you begin managing bigger teams and often move into a director or VP position. Project managers are typically a good fit for future COOs as well, thanks to operations experience.</li><li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px\"><b>Good salary.</b><br>According to a recent PMI report, “demand over the next 10 years for project managers is growing faster than demand for workers in other occupations.” It’s projected that “by 2027, employers will need nearly 88 million individuals in project management-oriented roles.” And jobs in high demand tend to command higher salaries.</li><li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px\"><b>Lots of industry options.</b><br>Some job types are specific to a handful of industries. For example, there are not a lot of physicians working at SaaS companies … nor are there many (or any, for that matter) construction workers working in the ER.<br><br>However, when it comes to project management, you can pretty much pick your industry: construction, architecture, software development, health care, law, finance, energy, and so on.</li><li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px\"><b>Uniqueness.</b><br>Projects are unique and temporary. Each new product development is a unique undertaking compared to the implementation of a new software system — one and done.<br><br>Additionally, executing on any strategic initiative requires a different set of initiatives this year compared to 3 or 5 or 10 years ago.<br><br>Although project managers often learn lessons from their past projects, they are continually leading and guiding a new and unique initiative every time.</li><li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px\"><b>Expand your knowledge.</b><br>While a project management role presupposes the need to know a lot about coordinating (project) teams, there’s still a lot you need to learn to achieve the best results.<br><br>Learning can come in the form of seminars and books and other skills-based learning initiatives. Additionally, you can learn from your colleagues, co-workers, and other industry experts.</li><li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px\"><b>Become more attentive to details.</b><br>Attention to detail is a primary requirement for most jobs. For a project management job, it’s essential. The finer details have a considerable impact on the overall output.<br><br>A career in project management helps you notice these details and ultimately predict how each of them might influence the project. With this knowledge, you will quickly build strategies and hone new ideas for purposes of team cooperation.</li><li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px\"><b>Make an impact.</b><br>Many people are continually looking to be in a position that’s meaningful and worthwhile to ensure they make a positive contribution to an industry or company.<br><br>In project management, you can work with different team members and feel challenged by problems that should be solved with a job that doesn’t leave you bored. As a project manager, you will feel rewarded when you keep your project schedules on track, meet the budget, and collaborate with colleagues to ensure everything runs efficiently.<br><br>Project managers help companies improve efficiency and save money to improve the organization’s performance as a whole. Although you will have a long list of responsibilities, you could make a positive impact on people around you. It is easy for you to remain stimulated in the role because you need to create new strategies that require you to experiment with different techniques that can help you meet your stakeholder’s needs.<br><br>If you want to pursue a career that allows you to feel fulfilled, working in project management will greatly enhance your professional life. You will feel stimulated and challenged in a position that will enable you to change industries and benefit anyone around you with the unique skills you develop.</li></ol></div>",
