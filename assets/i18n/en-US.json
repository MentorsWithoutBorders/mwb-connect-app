			},
			"how_to_relax": {
				"title": "How to relax",
				"text": "<span style=\"text-align:justify\">With your eyes open or closed, standing up, sitting on a chair or lying down, you just need to do the following: <ul><li>think of the number 10 and focus on how you're letting the forehead relax</li><li>think of 9 and focus on how you’re letting the neck relax</li><li>think of 8 and focus on how you’re letting the shoulders relax</li><li>think of 7 and focus on how you’re letting the arms relax</li><li>... and so on until you reach 1 and you focus on how you’re letting the feet relax</li><li><b>at the end you think of 0 and you keep focusing on how you're letting the entire body relax until you reach a really feel-good, relaxed state.</b></li></ul>This last step is the most important one by far because from 10 to 1 you’re just preparing the body to relax and you should never expect to be relaxed enough by the time you get to 1. The real relaxation comes when you think of 0 and you keep focusing on how you’re letting the entire body relax until you get to that really feel-good, relaxed state.<br><br>Sometimes you’ll have to keep your focus there for a few seconds, other times for a few tens of seconds but you’ll notice that <b>the more you focus on how you’re letting the entire body relax, the more relaxed your body will feel</b>, which means that you have complete control over the degree of relaxation that you want to get to.

Without doing the part at 0, the fast relaxation will never work and the slow one will only work very rarely.</span>"
			},
			"when_to_relax": {
				"title": "When to relax",
				"text": "<span style=\"text-align:justify\">The general rule of thumb is to <b>do the fast relaxation immediately when you feel any negative state</b>. Why immediately? Because the more you let any negative state manifest itself, the more you lose patience, joy and efficiency and any problem you encounter seems much bigger than it actually is.<br><br>There will be many times though when some negative states will keep coming back again and again and if you relax immediately in those moments it will feel more frustrating than relaxing. So only in those situations it’s best to let the negative emotions manifest themselves for a while and only then do the fast relaxation again.<br><br>If however you notice that some negative states keep coming back stronger and stronger and just by doing the fast relaxation you are not able to transition to a consistent feel-good state, then you need to take a bit more time to do the slow relaxation. This can happen anytime, anywhere but you’ll need at least 2–3 minutes of quiet time in order to do it efficiently.<br><br>You also need to keep in mind that if your body is in movement and you get into a negative state at some point, you have to stop the body first and only then relax.</span>"
