# MWB Connect app
This mobile app allows us to connect mentors with students from our partner NGOs (https://www.mentorswithoutborders.net/partners.php).

The architecture is similar to the one from this tutorial: https://medium.com/flutter-community/flutter-firebase-realtime-database-crud-operations-using-provider-c242a01f6a10

Running the app in:
* VS Code: https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/vs-code
* Android Studio and IntelliJ: https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/android-studio
