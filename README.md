# MWB Connect app
This mobile app allows us to connect mentors with students from our <a href="https://www.mentorswithoutborders.net/partners.php" target="_blank">partner NGOs</a> for one-off lessons.

The architecture is similar to the one from this <a href="https://medium.com/flutter-community/flutter-firebase-realtime-database-crud-operations-using-provider-c242a01f6a10" target="_blank">tutorial</a>. 

Running the app in:
* VS Code: https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/vs-code
* Android Studio and IntelliJ: https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/android-studio
